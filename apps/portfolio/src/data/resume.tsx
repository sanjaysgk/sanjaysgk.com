    "Researcher, builder, and aspiring entrepreneur. Turning scientific curiosity into research, products, and everything in between.",
  summary:
    "Curious by nature, builder by obsession. I can't help but ask *why*  and then immediately start building the answer. By day I work as a bioinformatician at Monash University, researching cancer genomics and immunopeptidomics. By night, I'm shipping side projects and hunting for the next problem worth solving. In the past, [I completed a Master of Data Science at Monash](/#education), worked as a Data Scientist and Analyst across healthtech and startups, and participated in Monash's Startup Validator program. I'm currently building [Scrollpaper](/#projects) (swipe through science, not social media), [LabScrib](/#projects) (turning lab meetings into actionable insights), and a SaaS platform making bioinformatics pipelines less painful.",
